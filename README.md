# VALORZONE - Esports Team Website

A website for Valorzone, a professional Valorant esports team. Built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

## About The Project

This is a website I made for my ITWM101 course. It shows a professional esports team with pages for the team members, tournaments, and contact info. The site works on phones, tablets, and computers.

## What's Included

- **Home Page** - Shows what Valorzone is about
- **Team Page** - Lists all the team members and their roles
- **Tournaments Page** - Shows upcoming and past tournaments
- **Contact Page** - Has a form to contact the team

## How It Works

### On Your Computer
1. Download the files
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Click the menu to go to different pages

### Using a Server
If you want to run it on a local server:

**Python:**
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then go to: `http://localhost:8000`
